<h1 class="title">Python Notes<br />
Topic 1</h1>
<p class="author">Ajeet Singh Parmar</p>

<h1 id="why-python-for-data-science">Why Python for Data Science?</h1>
<p>Python was created by Guide Van Rossum and first released in 1991. The name Python was inspired by the comedy series Monty Python’s Flying circus.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-of-python">Advantages of Python:</h2>
<p>Following are the some of major advantages of Python:</p>
<h3 id="easy-to-learn">Easy to learn:</h3>
<p>Python is a very beginner friendly language. The syntax (words and structure) is extremely simple to read and follow, most of which can be understood even if you do not know programming.</p>
<h3 id="versatility">Versatility:</h3>
<p>Python is a multi paradigm programming language. It supports object oriented programming, structured programming and functional programming patterns among others. Python can handle any job ranging from data mining to website construction to running embeded system. It is all in one united language.</p>
<h3 id="community-support">Community Support:</h3>
<p>Python’s broad and diverse base means that there are millions of users who are happy to offer advice and suggestions when you get stuck on something. Chances are high that someone else would have been stuck there before you. Open source communities are known for there open discussion policies. In fact most of the queries can be solved by a single google search.</p>
<h3 id="awesome-free-libraries">Awesome free libraries:</h3>
<p>The libraries form the backbone for the success of any programming language. At present more than 140,000 projects exists in the Python Package Installer(PyPI). Data Science has been early beneficiary of these libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Scikit learn are extremely popular and widely used by data scientists worldwide. Do you want to start doing Deep learning? No Problem! Python has libraries like Tensorflow, Pytorch and Keras to help you.</p>
<h3 id="interpreted-language">Interpreted language:</h3>
<p>Python is an interpreted language, not compiled one. This means that the original program is translated into "something else". Another program "the interpreter" then examines "something else" and performs whatever actions are called for. Besides, Python is dynamically typed, i.e., we don’t need to define variable datatype ahead of time; Python automatically guesses the datatype of variable based on the type of value it contains.</p>
<h1 id="variables-and-print-statement">Variables and Print Statement</h1>
<h2 id="what-are-variables">What are Variables?</h2>
<p>Variables are used to store values in memory. We can store integers, decimals, characters, words or sentences in a variable. In order to define a variable we use equals (=) sign.</p>
<p>1 0 Paul</p>
<h1 id="datatypes-in-python">Datatypes in Python</h1>
<p>Python has five standard data types listed as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Boolean</p></li>
<li><p>Numbers</p></li>
<li><p>String</p></li>
<li><p>Dictionary</p></li>
<li><p>Tuple</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="boolean">Boolean</h2>
<p>Boolean is nothing but True(1) and False(0) statements. Their sole purpose is to evaluate the conditions.</p>
<p>True True False</p>
<h3 id="we-will-take-a-look-in-other-datatypes-in-upcoming-topics">We will take a look in other datatypes in upcoming topics</h3>
<h1 id="how-to-use-print-statement">How to use print statement?</h1>
<h2 id="the-print-function">The print() function:</h2>
<p>The print() function is used to display the variable’s result as we have used above.</p>
<p>The syntax is print(*objects, sep=‘ ’, end=‘\n’, file = sys.stdout, flush=False) Here,<br />
1. objects is are the values to be displayed.<br />
2. sep is the separator used between values (default is a space charactor).<br />
3. After all values are printed, end is printed(default is a new line charactor).<br />
4. file is the object where the values are printed(default value is sys.stdout i.e. screen).<br />
5. flush is used to specify if the output has to be flushed (True) or buffered (False). Its default value is False.</p>
<p>Note: The values given after equals sign are default values, if we do not pass any values then the parameters automatically takes defaut values, otherwise we can give them values of our choice as in the following example.</p>

<h1 id="determining-the-type-of-object-with-type-function">Determining the type of object with type() function:</h1>
<p>If you are confused about which class the object belongs to, then simply use the type function.</p>
<p>&lt;class ’str’&gt;</p>
<p>The above output says that the variable name belongs to class str, which make sense as name contains ‘Ajeet’ which is obviously a string.</p>
<h1 id="checking-instance-type-with-instance">Checking Instance type with instance()</h1>
<p>The instance() function checks if the subject (first argument) is an instance or a subclass of classinfo(second argument). Its syntax is: instance(object, classinfo)</p>
<p>It returns True if the object is an instance or subclass of the class or any element of tuple, otherwise it returns False.</p>
<p>True False</p>
<p>In the next topic, you will get a brief overview of the different datatypes and how to create an object of that datatype alongwith some of its properties. So be excited :)</p>
